/* 
 * The employment office lists all possible jobs (which are defined in each individual
 * location object's `jobs` property) and lets the player apply for them.
 * What it first does is create a list of items based on every PLACE that has jobs. It does
 * this by just cycling over the locations and seeing if the `jobs` property has any members
 * in it. Then it makes it so that if the player clicks on that place name, it creates a new
 * menu OVER the existing one, that lists all of the jobs. If they click on the specific job,
 * then it "applies" for the job (checks if their stats are right, as well as a random chance
 * that there are no positions open that week). This new menu also replaces the original DONE
 * button and makes it basically a "back" button (which works by just resetting the location
 * screen).
