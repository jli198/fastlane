/* 
 * The university is a place where education is acquired.
 * This is complicated for two reasons: 
 * 		1. you don't just "buy" education, you make "progress" in it after "enrolling" in a course.
 *    2. the game uses a totally different appearance (books) for this versus other items.
 * But as such it is a nice example of how flexible this system can be.
 * This location object has a property called `degrees` that is only used by the code inside
 * this particular module. What it does is it builds the menu of items based on what degrees
 * the player already has (in scene.player.degrees), and what progress they have made in them.
 * The `degrees` property has all of the prerequisites in it in its `required` field (in the
 * original Jones game, there can only be one prereq for each degree, so I've implemented that
 * here, but you could imagine a slight rework that would allow multiple prereqs, storing it
 * as an array). 
 * The menu is built up through custom objects -- each menu item is a container with an image
 * of a book in it, a text object with the degree name, and a text object with the progress
 * level. 
 * There is also a custom button, ENROLL, which adds an "Enrollment Receipt" into the inventory.
 * This is "spent" whenever they start a new course. (It probably ought to check if there are
 * any courses yet to take before even creating to ENROLL button, but it doesn't.)
 * Note that the ENROLL button is one of the few popup speech bubbles that uses the `choices`
 * property to prompt the player to say "Yes" or "No" to enrolling (the Rent Office also does this).
