/* 
 * The fast food restaurant (and only restaurant in the original game).
 * 
 * It is not that remarkable as a location, and as such is probably a good place to start when 
 * thinking about how the locations objects work. It has several possible welcome messages, 
 * and it has several possible jobs the player can have.
 *
 * When the player buys food, it sets various properties, like the "ate" flag and sometimes
 * the happiness flag. You could imagine having other flags, like health or something like that,
 * which might be affected if you ate a week's worth of french fries.
 *
