/* Pawn Shop is not implemented -- same as an empty square. 
 * 
 * I didn't implement it because I never found myself using it.
 * It would also be a little tricky because it needs a sort of "listbox" menu
 * control that would have to be hand-coded, and I didn't want to do that just 
 * for this.
