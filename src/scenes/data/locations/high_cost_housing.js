/* 
 * This is the high-cost housing option. It is very bare-bones. Like low_cost_housing,
 * its images and options vary depending on whether the player lives there. Otherwise
 * it does nothing special. In the original game, it would prevent the robbery mechanic
 * from stealing things, but since that mechanic is not implemented, it doesn't do that.
 * And in the original game, the appearance would change depending on if the player bought
 * certain items, but that isn't implemented either (yet).
