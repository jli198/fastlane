/* 
 * The clothing store sells clothes, and is a place the player can work.
 * 
 * The only tricky thing here is that the player's outfit needs to be changed,
 * which also changes the image that is used for the player in the game. So you can
 * see below that it does this by destroying the existing player image and then
 * creating it anew.
