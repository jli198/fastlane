/* 

low_cost_housing is a place the player can live.

Slightly tricky things:
	- Its functionality is totally tied to whether the player lives there or not (if 
		scene.player.home.location is set to its id). This includes:
			- Its image
			- Its speech characteristics
			- Its buttons (RELAX)
	- So the image, speech, and buttons properties are all functions. The items property is also
		a function because it sets up a silly little easter egg (the poster talks in some circumstances).
