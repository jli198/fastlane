## Assignment

So here is your much-vaunted midterm assignment — the Stevens Student Simulator.

1. Download our Stevens-specific Fastlane code for Phaser: fastlane

2. As with the Phaser demo assignment, unzip the directory somewhere useful, then go into the directory from the console and run **npm install**.

3. Make sure it works by running **npm start**

OK! Now you are up and running. </br>
</br>
This will be a **group assignment**. We will figure out groups in class. **If you are not in a group, let me know ASAP and I will make sure you are in one**. We will have time next week to work on this in class — you will not have any other homework this or next week. </br>
</br>
**Your group's task is to modify the code and graphics of the Fastlane code so that it better represents what the life of a Stevens student is like.** "Better represents" is pretty subjective here: it will not and cannot be a perfect simulation! But I am expecting you to, at the least, modify some of the "locations" so they better represent the kinds of places that Stevens students might go, modify what kinds of variables are tracked about the player (the student), and ultimately tell the player (me) something significant about what life as a Stevens student is like. This is a model and a work of art: you are not trying to represent things PERFECTLY, but you should have an INTENT in what you are trying to convey. </br>
</br>
The amount of code modification will really be up to you. At a minimum this could involve some very slight changes to the data files (notably the locations) and perhaps the code that runs every week (startWeek()), and probably some modifications to the graphics. At a maximum, the system I've created is very flexible and you could imagine really going wild with it, or even expanding it to do things it doesn't do right now at all. </br>
</br>
This code was created by me in a fever dream over the last 2 weeks so I am sure it has bugs. If you run into real problems, reach out to me — I can probably help you. </br>
</br>
Each group should produce **one** game for the whole group. But each member of the ground should also write up a short (3-4 page) essay. This essay (which you will submit to Canvas here) should explain:

1. Who was in the group and how you partitioned up the labor for this project (programming, graphics, research, etc. are all "labor"). Make sure you also indicate whose OneDrive account contains the file game files (they will need to put them there).

2. What the changes you made to the base game were in the end.

3. What your INTENT was — what you were trying to capture about the life of a Stevens student with your changes. Explain the choices you made, as if someone really wanted to know why you made them. Why make one choice and not another? Go through the thought process.

4. Reflect on this assignment — what we difficult, what was easy, what you learned, what was frustrating, what you might want to have changed if someone has forced to do it again in the future, etc.

This assignment, like the rest of this class, is highly experimental. So if you run into huge problems, don't despair, just reach out to me. If people are floundering we'll figure it out. </br>
</br>
**Each group should have at least one person in it who is somewhat comfortable with the coding. I may redistribute such people among groups if it is necessary. This does not mean that the coding person needs to do ALL of the coding work, and it also means that non-coders should be occupying themselves with figuring out how they can contribute in an equivalent way.** A lot of the work involved will be figuring out the structure of the simulation, for example. And coming up with silly graphics.
